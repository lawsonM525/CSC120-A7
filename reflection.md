- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I decided to overload the `moveIn` method in `House.java` to take in both a single String and an array of strings. This way it is possible for house presidents to enter multiple new students at a go (for times like move in day), while they can also add a single sudent without having to include their name in an array (for times like in the middle of the semester hen a student is switchng houses).

I also decided to overload the `sellCoffee` class in `Cafe.java` as some sales may not cause reductions in sugar packet and/or creams (some people may not want cream or sugar in their coffee). This class only allows for creams to be added alog with sugar packets. In this case, a `0` could be put in the `nSugarPackets` parameter.
