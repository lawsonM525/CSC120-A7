Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I decided to overload the `moveIn` method in `House.java` to take in both a single String and an array of strings. This way it is possible for house presidents to enter multiple new students at a go (for times like move in day), while they can also add a single sudent without having to include their name in an array (for times like in the middle of the semester hen a student is switchng houses).

I also decided to double overload the `sellCoffee` class in `Cafe.java` as some sales may not cause reductions in sugar packet and/or creams (some people may not want cream or sugar in their coffee). This class only allows for creams to be added alog with sugar packets. In this case, a `0` could be put in the `nSugarPackets` parameter.

I also overloaded the `addTitle` method in `Library` to be able to take in ISB numbers as book titles as well.

I also overloaded the constructors for `Library` and `House` because I didn't have all the information for some of the libraries and houses I added to `CampusMap.java`

All in al, this assignment felt so easy to do because I could think of the programming as objects in real life istead of complex logical code. I really enjoyed it and I wish I had staretd working on it earlier.

To future student: Even if the coding feels hard at firts, it eventually starts to get fun. Have faith! <3
